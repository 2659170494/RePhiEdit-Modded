## A note on the 1.3.0 update: 

Sorry about the note placement bug in improvisation. 

I've noticed that already but it was way beyond my ability on reverse engineering to fix it.

I will update as soon as possible once I got a solution for that.

Currently ; and / place put note in the same place.

Very disgusting bug!

I must fix this but sorry I was unable to complete this task without the help from you guys.

If you got a solution for this problem, please submit a issue on github to let me see.

Thanks.
